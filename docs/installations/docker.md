Docker is a way to run software in a container. This means that the software is isolated from the rest of your system. This is useful because it means that you can run software without having to install it on your system. This is particularly useful for running software that has a lot of dependencies or that you only need to run occasionally. In this way, Docker is a bit like a virtual machine and enables running software without configuring the system to run it.

To install Docker, follow the instructions for your operating system on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
